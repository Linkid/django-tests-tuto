Test driven dev
===============

Voc
---

Functional test:
    describes a new functionality from user’s point of view.

Unit test:
    defines how we want our code to behave — each line of code we write should
    be tested by (at least) one of our unit tests


Workflow
--------

1. write a functional test
2. write a unit test
3. write the minimum application code to get the unit test to pass
4. run the coverage test
5. go to 2 until you get the functional test to pass
6. go to 1 until the app is completed


Methods
-------

* setUp: called at the beginning
* tearDown: called at the end


Coverage
--------

pip install coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test myapp
coverage html


Web Tools
---------

* Travis-CI: to run several tests with a configuration file (tavis.yml)
* Coveralls: to run a coverage test
